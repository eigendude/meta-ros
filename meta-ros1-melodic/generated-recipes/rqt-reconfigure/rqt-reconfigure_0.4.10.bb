DESCRIPTION = "This rqt plugin succeeds former dynamic_reconfigure's GUI 		(reconfigure_gui), and provides the way to view and edit the parameters 		that are accessible via dynamic_reconfigure.<br/> 		<br/> 		(12/27/2012) In the future, arbitrary parameters that are not associated 		with any nodes (which are not handled by dynamic_reconfigure) might 		become handled. 		However, currently as the name indicates, this pkg solely is dependent 		on dynamic_reconfigure that allows access to only those params latched 		to nodes."
