DESCRIPTION = "<p>       ROS-Industrial support for the ABB IRB 6600 (and variants).     </p>     <p>       This package contains configuration data, 3D models and launch files       for ABB IRB 6600 manipulators. This currently includes the base model.     </p>     <p>       Joint limits and max joint velocities are based on the information in       the ABB data sheets.  All URDFs / XACROs are based on the       default motion and joint velocity limits, unless noted otherwise (ie:       no support for high speed joints, extended / limited motion ranges or       other options).     </p>     <p>       Before using any of the configuration files and / or meshes included       in this package, be sure to check they are correct for the particular       robot model and configuration you intend to use them with.     </p>     <p>       The unqualified IRB 6400 model will be removed in ROS-Lunar, please       use the abb_irb6640_support as a replacement.     </p>"
